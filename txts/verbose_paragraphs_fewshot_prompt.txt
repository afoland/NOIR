# What is Paraphrasing?
Paraphrasing refers to the process of rephrasing a piece of text or information while retaining its original meaning. It is an essential tool used by writers, editors, and students to convey the same message in different ways, making it easier for readers to understand and remember the information. Paraphrasing is important because it helps to improve writing skills, avoid plagiarism, and enhance comprehension by presenting information in a more concise and clear manner. Additionally, paraphrasing can be used to tailor information to different audiences, making it more accessible and engaging for readers.  Paraphrasing can be verbose and wordy, expanding the length of the passage, or concise and succinct, shortening the passage.
