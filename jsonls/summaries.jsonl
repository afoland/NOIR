However, this perspective is often overlooked by critics. The 19th-century NRA, particularly in the Southern states, did not seem to advocate for gun rights for black people, thereby potentially perpetuating racism. This is a crucial takeaway from the animation. In relation to Buell's shooting in Flint, describing a six-year-old as a \"pencil-stabbing thug,\" as mentioned in the critique, reflects the sensationalism and oversimplification that Moore's film cautions against. This type of response typically comes from those seeking straightforward explanations that align with the conservative viewpoint. Instead of attributing complex issues such as drug use to mere enjoyment, research indicates that the CIA allowed crack sales in U.S. cities to finance operations involving South American 'contras.' Furthermore, the so-called 'war on drugs,' initiated during Nixon's presidency, has proven to be a failed policy leading to excessive incarceration rates both relatively and absolutely, making the United States the global leader in prison population.", "summary_2": "Michael Moore's film discusses historic ties between white gun rights promotion and black restriction, criticizing the 19th-century NRA's lack of advocacy for black gun rights.

Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country.Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems.International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency.Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds.As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased.Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll.In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.", "summary_1": "Al Qaeda executed its first significant terrorism operation independently in 1998, largely due to Osama bin Laden losing his Sudan base. The Islamist administration in Khartoum had long provided shelter to terrorist entities under international and regional pressure, including countries like Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya - all targets of these radical groups. However, changes within the Sudanese administration led to the decline of Turabi's influence and an increase in Bashir's authority. A turning point was reached after the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995, linked to the Egyptian Islamic Group and supported by Bin Laden. Following Sudan's refusal to extradite suspects tied to this event, the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in April 1996. As Libya demanded the expulsion of its opponents residing in Sudan, Bin Laden faced mounting financial difficulties. International pressure weakened Sudan's economy, affecting Bin Laden's businesses negatively.

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms present on Earth, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. This rich tapestry of life supports various ecological processes, such as pollination, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and natural pest control. By safeguarding endangered species, we help preserve these vital functions and contribute to healthier ecosystems.\n\nEndemic species, those unique to specific regions, play essential roles within their habitats. Their extinction could lead to cascading effects throughout food chains, disrupting entire ecosystems. Moreover, protecting endangered species fosters resilience against environmental fluctuations and climate change. A diverse gene pool enhances adaptability, enabling populations to better respond to shifting conditions.\n\nMedical research benefits from studying rare and threatened species. These organisms possess unique biochemistry and physiology that might hold keys to developing novel pharmaceuticals, therapies, or treatments for human diseases. Losing even a single species could mean losing potential breakthroughs in healthcare technology.\n\nLastly, conserving endangered species reflects our ethical obligation towards future generations.

{"text": "After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad.Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert.Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps.Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before.The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks.At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell.The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day.Clarke's staff warned, \"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\"Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\"Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\"he wrote.Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a  Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights.The CSG met daily.Berger said that the principals met constantly.Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \"training and experience.\"It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention.There was a mounting sense of public alarm.The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season.The FBI was more communicative during the millennium crisis than it had ever been.", "summary_1": "Following the thwarted attack in Amman, authorities discovered that suspect Ahmed Ressam had resided in California and worked as a taxi driver in Boston, while another conspirator named Deek held American citizenship and had connections to radical groups both domestically and overseas. Prior to Ressam's capture, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger opted against publicly addressing potential threats within the U.S., though he did order increased vigilance among FBI field offices. Post-arrest, the FBI sought additional FISA wiretaps, leading Berger and CIA head George Tenet to observe a surge in such surveillance requests. The FBI cautioned local law enforcement without causing widespread panic. On December 21, FBI Director Louis Freeh updated senior officials on ongoing probes into ties between Ressam and a Montreal-based terror cell, along with other leads like alleged plots targeting multiple U.S. urban centers and encounters involving suspicious individuals near the Canadian border. In response to these developments, Clarke urged relevant domestic agencies to maintain high readiness levels. A contentious internal debate ensued regarding the likelihood of aviation-related assaults, culminating in the Principals Committee discussing a foreign intelligence report suggesting al-Qaeda aimed to plant explosives aboard transatlantic flights. Despite escalating public concern over potential strikes, Ressam's apprehension seemed unrelated to any heightened national vigilance; instead, customs officer Diana Dean attributed the bust to her professional training and expertise.", "summary_2": "Ahmed Ressam was found living in California after an attempted attack in Amman. He drove taxis in Boston, and his accomplice, Deek, was an American citizen linked to extremist organizations. Before Ressam's arrest, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger chose not to disclose possible US threats but ordered enhanced vigilance by FBI field offices. After Ressam's arrest, the FBI applied for more FISA wiretaps, prompting Berger and CIA chief George Tenet to note a rise in such applications. The FBI alerted local police without causing alarm. By December 21, FBI Director Louis Freeh informed top officials about investigations linking Ressam to a Montreal terrorist group and various US city targets. Officials were advised to stay vigilant due to suspected plans to bomb airplanes, based on a foreign intel report. However, Ressam's arrest appeared unconnected to increased national watchfulness, being rather credited to custom agent Diana Dean's skills.", "summary_3": "After Ahmed Ressam's arrest in Washington state, it's learned he lived in California and had an American accomplice, Deek; before his arrest, increased FBI vigilance was ordered due to potential US threats, leading to more FISA wiretap requests and heightened local law enforcement awareness; Ressam's ties to a Canadian terror cell targeting US cities with plane bombings were discovered, but his capture resulted from a customs agent's actions, not boosted national surveillance."}

{"text": "Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as $49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems.The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor.The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years.Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds.But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated.After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said.The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\" to the cause, Harrison said.Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140.Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing.Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \"paying full annual registration fees.\"In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission.The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million.Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount.This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between $700,000 and $1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois.Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available.\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\" Schmitt said.\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\"Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.", "summary_1": "Illinois lawyers might see an increase of up to $49 annually in their registration fees due to proposed legislations aimed at enhancing pro-bono services and assistance for lawyers grappling with substance abuse issues.

Currently, financial support for non-profit legal aid organizations originates from interest accumulated in the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which holds clients' money managed by attorneys for various purposes like escrow funds. However, owing to reduced interest rates and economic downturn, the fund has been generating less income. After extensive deliberation, the Supreme Court concluded that increasing registration fees offers the most viable solution to this issue. Although hesitant initially, the judges consented that backing pro-bono initiatives is crucial and lawyers should contribute accordingly. In 2021, the basic attorney registration fee increased to $180 from $140. New practitioners and inactive attorneys currently pay $90, while retired lawyers do not pay any fee. A draft bill suggests that the new levy will affect attorneys paying full annual registration fees. In 2001, Illinois had 57,392 actively practicing attorneys and 74,311 registered attorneys overall. This adjustment could generate approximately $2.4 million. Last year, the Lawyers' Trust Fund earned $4.5 million in interest; however, expenses and handling charges claimed $538,000.

Supporting American colonies against Britain led to a devastating 1780 war, wiping out much of the Dutch navy and marking a significant drop in their power. Anti-Orange factions promoting French alliance emerged, culminating in Napoleon claiming the Netherlands in 1806, establishing his brother Louis as monarch. After public unrest over tax hikes, Napoleon left, and William of Orange assumed kingship in 1813, signaling steady expansion despite economic struggles. Industrialization took off, marked by Central Station's construction, ending Amsterdam's maritime era and ushering in an age of mechanization.", "summary_3": "After the post-expansion period, European competition resulted in wars, including the 1665-1667 Anglo-Dutch War where the Dutch severely damaged the British fleet. Despite financial success in the 18th century, supporting American colonies led to a disastrous 1780 war, diminishing their naval strength. This paved the way for anti-Orange factions advocating for a French alliance, ultimately leading to Napoleon seizing the Netherlands in 1806 and installing his brother as monarch. Following public dissent over taxes, Napoleon departed, and William of Orange ascended to the throne in 1813, initiating gradual growth amidst ongoing economic challenges. A shift towards industrialization occurred, symbolized by Central Station's establishment, concluding Amsterdam's maritime epoch and commencing an era of technological advancement."}

{"text": "It's just this hard when I try to answer the question: Why do older Oklahomans need lawyers?The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m.March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol.The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care.But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute.Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older.Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment.Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick.(By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.\"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.", "summary_1": "Older Oklahomans often find themselves requiring legal assistance due to various reasons related to healthcare, housing, and childcare.

{"text": "As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack.The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country.Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance.Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding.We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999.It appears they supported themselves.KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as $10,000, to perform their roles in the plot.After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money.Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky.According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States.Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7.Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm.We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money.The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements.By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States.Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.", "summary_1": "Al Qaeda financed the 9/11 attacks, providing approximately $400,000 to $500,000 for the operation.

Before joining the plot, the Hamburg cell members, including Mohamed Atta, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah, appeared to fund themselves. Post selection, however, they started receiving funds from al Qaeda. For instance, each member got $5,000 for their return to Germany from Afghanistan and further funds for traveling from Germany to the U.S. Al Qaeda met several operational requirements for executing the 9/11 plot, including competent leadership, secure communication channels, effective recruitment and training processes, reliable intelligence gathering, efficient manpower allocation, and adequate financing.

However, the latter part of the 16th century brought adversity when King Sebastian I assumed the throne at age 14, leading to unfortunate events such as the Battle of Alcacer-Quiber where he and approximately 18,000 supporters perished in a fruitless crusade. After Sebastian I's death, uncertainty ensued due to unsubstantiated claims about his survival and several false pretenders emerging, causing instability. Eventually, the elderly Prince Henry surfaced as the legitimate heir but passed away shortly afterward, leaving no successor. Seizing the opportunity, Spain took control of Portugal, involving the nation in their conflicts. In 1587, English privateer Sir Francis Drake targeted the Algarve region, previously protected under the 1386 Treaty of Windsor, looting Sagres and destroying historical artifacts. By 1596, Faro suffered a similar fate. As a result, much of Portugal's empire diminished, and numerous trading posts fell into the hands of the British and Dutch.

{"text": "Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Durer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'.Durer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety.Nonetheless, Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code.In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naive approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass').However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Durer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images.Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Durer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things.Durer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.\"", "summary_1": "Albrecht Dürer's theories on aesthetics are detailed in an appended essay in his last book, written between 1512 and 1528.

Unlike Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci, Dürer delves deeper into the creative process behind beautiful artworks. His viewpoint transitions from perceiving human creativity as impulsive or divinely inspired to recognizing it as a 'selective internal synthesis.'

{"text": "Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements.Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings.This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation.In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall.It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern.Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living.This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \"middling\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes.In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe.In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money.The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted.At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men.In fact, it did quite the opposite.The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.", "summary_1": "Tocqueville observed that democratic values in America were replacing traditional European ones, particularly regarding inheritance and wealth distribution. The end of primogeniture and entails led to more equally divided land among offspring, unlike the usual aristocratic practice of passing down entire estates to one heir. This shift fostered closer sibling relationships, altering the dynamic of older/younger sibling dynamics prevalent in aristocracy. As a result, securing lasting familial wealth became challenging, compelling individuals to strive independently. In America, there was an emphasis on personal success driven by hard work, whereas Europeans typically didn't concern themselves with financial gain due to predetermined class roles. Despite acknowledging the importance of balanced property ownership in political stability, Tocqueville noted that egalitarian wealth distribution ironically fueled disdain towards societal elites in America.", "summary_2": "Tocqueville noticed significant differences between American and European societies. In America, equal division of inherited land contrasted with the European tradition of undivided inheritance for the eldest child.

While aware of the role of equitable property ownership in political balance, Tocqueville also recognized how it sparked resentment towards societal elites in America.", "summary_3": "Tocqueville observed that America's equal division of inherited land fostered individual effort and hard work, while making it challenging to maintain family wealth and sometimes sparking resentment towards societal elites."}

Caesar warned about potential threats from Germanic tribes, such as the Franks, Alamans, and Saxons. During Roman rule, Gallic soldiers safeguarded frontiers, allowing families to farm or build cities, resulting in significant road systems. Additionally, commerce thrived due to widespread trade inside the Roman Empire.

Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately $300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda.In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about $1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a $300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad.Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994.The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale.This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune.Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda.When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.", "summary_1": "Al-Qaeda financed the 9/11 attacks, which cost around $400,000-$500,000, mostly supplied by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM).

{"text": "On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it.At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges.Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports.But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\"Rubber Ridley\" to his friends, \"Mad Ridley\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula.World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income.The Malay ruling class again took a back seat.Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government.The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security.The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness.Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population.The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority.Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939.In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei.Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century.This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.", "summary_1": "In the 20th century, the British expanded their governance over the Malay Peninsula, implementing various aspects of colonial administration such as civil service, public works, justice system, law enforcement, postal services, education, and land management. This was facilitated by a team of British administrators, educators, engineers, and medical professionals. Concurrently, the tin industry, previously controlled by Chinese workers utilizing labor-intensive methods, transitioned to Western management employing advanced technology like gravel pumps and mining dredges. Oil discovery in North Borneo (at Miri) and Brunei led to the Anglo-Dutch Shell company using Singapore as a hub for oil supply and export. However, the most significant development was the rise of the rubber industry. A new gardening technique, championed by Singapore's garden director, Henry Ridle, resulted in improved planting and tapping methods, making rubber Malaya's primary source of income by 1920, surpassing tin production. Despite the British controlling the rubber and tin industries and governing the region, the Malay rulers retained influence over local and religious matters, enjoying their status, wealth, and safety. The 1931 census triggered concerns about Malay national identity due to an increase in immigrant population driven by the rubber and tin boom in the 1920s, causing non-Malays to marginally outnumber the native inhabitants. As the Great Depression hit in 1929, heightened ethnic competition emerged in the dwindling job market, leading to the emergence of nationalistic sentiments aimed at protecting Malay interests against Chinese and Indian communities instead of opposing British rule. Although limited by the division between the States and the Straits Settlements, Muslim scholars and community leaders initiated the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939, followed by representation from Sarawak and Brunei in Singapore the subsequent year. Educators and journalists advocated for restoring the shared Malay-Indonesian consciousness, divided by the Anglo-Dutch partition of the region in the 19th century. This movement contributed to the escalating tensions preceding the impending war.", "summary_2": "The British exerted control over Malaysia in the 20th century, introducing modern governance and technology, particularly in the burgeoning rubber industry.

{"text": "Alexander earned the epithet \"The Great\" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander.He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered.This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops.The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces.Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons.He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king.In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000.Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi).By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry.This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's scimitars and javelins.Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes.Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming.The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style.Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center.", "summary_1": "Known as \"The Great,\" Alexander achieved remarkable feats as a military leader, remaining undefeated throughout his career.

Post the failed December 1998 plan to strike Kandahar with cruise missiles, Shelton and other Pentagon officials devised a strategy utilizing an advanced AC-130 gunship instead. This Spooky model boasted superior precision compared to cruise missiles, thus reducing risks of collateral damage significantly. After receiving encouragement from Clarke, Shelton ordered Zinni and General Schoomaker to strategize an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's base in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff drafted a decision memo for deploying the specialized aircraft. Despite ongoing interest from Berger and Clarke, no further action was taken.

Encouraged by Clarke, Shelton directs Zinni and Schoomaker to prepare an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's base in Afghanistan.

{"text": "Clarifying the Record The defense of U.S. airspace on 9/11 was not conducted in accord with preexisting training and protocols.It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction.As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth.We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities.NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew.Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly.More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response.Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources.In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning.In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA.This statement was incorrect.There was no hijack to report at 9:16.United 93 was proceeding normally at that time.In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77.This statement was also incorrect.The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C.

Similarly, claims stating that NEADS became aware of American 77's hijacking at 9:24 were incorrect.

The speed of water flow relates directly to its ability to cause erosion; swifter currents yield greater impact. Water movement varies based on gradient, moving quicker down steep inclines, thereby increasing erosive force. Particle transportation by water depends on particle size, with larger elements transported during high-velocity flows while smaller ones move along when the pace decreases. As water velocity subsides, deposition begins, starting with larger materials initially before gradually incorporating finer fragments. Following intense precipitation events, runoff generates significant erosion and collects sediment from landscapes. This runoff then conveys the majority of this sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams produce distinctive, narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls through persistent erosion. Slower-moving rivers generate expansive floodplains and meandering channels due to deposition. Streams and rivers also contribute to forming alluvial fans and deltas via accumulation at terminals. Flooding might result in natural levee formation alongside riverbanks. Groundwater circulation can induce subsurface cavern development and dissolution, leading to cave systems and sinkhole generation. Over time, residual mineral-rich water dripping within these cavities forms stalactite and stalagmite structures.", "summary_2": "Water flow causes both erosion and deposition, influenced by water speed and landscape gradient. Faster flows increase erosion, carrying larger particles. Slowing down leads to deposition, starting with bigger particles first.

Gradually, slower rivers create wide floodplains and winding channels. Accumulated sediments form alluvial fans, deltas, and natural levees near terminals.

{"text": "Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \"softening\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori.First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\"barbarian-subduing great general\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals.Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor.The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable.The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent.In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power.Neither could exist without the other.A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime.The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment.And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy.Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto.Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \"Eastern barbarians,\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes.Kamakura was falling apart.", "summary_1": "Yoritomo Minamoto became Japan's new ruler after defeating the Taira clan, establishing his government in Kamakura, distancing himself from the softening influence of the imperial court. As the first national ruler to hold the title of sei-i tai-shogun, he strengthened his power by seizing land from defeated Taira members and distributing it among his samurai vassals. After Minamoto's death in 1199, the feudal system remained under the control of the Hojo family, functioning as regents for subsequent figurehead shoguns, similar to how the Fujiwara had managed emperors before. The illusion of Japanese imperial power persisted, with the emperor in Kyoto legitimizing a military dictatorship led by a Hojo regent. In this society, both symbolic authority and actual power were essential; one couldn't survive without the other. A failed Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime since there were no typical wartime benefits for regional lords or samurais due to an exhausted treasury caused by natural disasters and disease. Buddhist temples increased their political involvement, supporting imperial aspirations to restore power in Kyoto. Meanwhile, the Kamakura warriors indulged in lavish lifestyles, seeking sophistication through expensive feasts, clothing, and luxurious homes.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran.And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media.But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued.On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \"waging war against God\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record.There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year.Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women.Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism.And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani.Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists.The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership.Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people.See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade.One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \"solidarity\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress.While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.", "summary_1": "Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit to the U.N.

{"text": "Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries.Two quintessential novellas, \"The Lust of the White Serpant\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband.But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \"Pagoda\".Whalen Lai notes, \"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man.She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\".But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate?Her dangerous sexuality is the key.Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century", "summary_1": "The tale of Madame White Snake, a shape-shifting serpent who assumes human form and marries a man, has significantly influenced East Asian lore and literature.

Initially depicted as a malevolent spirit draining her human spouse's vitality, Madame White Snake evolved into a more empathetic character over time. She embodies the virtuous traits of a traditional Chinese wife, such as patience and nurturance, yet cannot coexist peacefully with her human partner due to her volatile sexuality.

However, a comprehensive account of Ibiza's history begins during its colonization by the Carthaginians in the 7th century B.C. Originally hailing from modern-day Lebanon, the Carthaginians established themselves across North Africa and southern Spain, vying for control over the Mediterranean against the expanding Roman Empire. They focused on Ibiza primarily because of its expansive salt flats, utilizing them to preserve fish for exportation back to their homeland. Additionally, they engaged in lead mining, producing lead shot allegedly utilized by the famed Carthaginian commander Hannibal. Upon conquest, the Carthaginians regarded Ibiza as sacred ground, interring thousands of their deceased in an extensive cemetery situated on Puig des Molins, beneath the Old Town of Ibiza. This burial ground yielded numerous artifacts including sculptures, jewelry, pottery, instruments, and currency, all currently exhibited within Ibiza's dual archaeological museums.

Established in 1974, the LSC allocates almost all its funds to state and local organizations that offer civil legal assistance to individuals earning below 125% of the federal poverty line. These resources are used primarily for defending low-income clients in various cases, including domestic violence, child custody disputes, and other legal issues.

{"text": "U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism.But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region.In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue.\"We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,\" he said.But at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups.The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence.On Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers.\"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,\" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday.Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum.Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news.It would be the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took office.Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday.He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have \"some ideas and some initiatives\" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri.Indonesia is already receiving $400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional $16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism.At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another $17 million in \"counterterrorism fellowships,\" some of which could go to Indonesia.But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval.\"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause,\" Powell said in Singapore.He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country.", "summary_1": "Colin Powell, U.S. Secretary of State, visited various countries in Southeast Asia to strengthen cooperation against global terrorism.
