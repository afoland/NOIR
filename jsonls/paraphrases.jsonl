As a consequence, promising possibilities can be unwittingly disregarded as a direct outcome of an intense concentration on previous episodes or imagined outcomes.", "A wise man once said, \"When one door closes, another opens,\" but sometimes we get caught up looking back at the closed door instead of moving forward towards the new opportunity.", "A wise person once noted, \"One door closes, another opens,\" but all too often, we dwell on the closed door rather than embracing the opened one.", "It was wisely observed, \"One door closes, another opens,\" yet how often do we linger on the shut door instead of focusing on the newly opened one?", "A wise saying goes, \"One door closes, another opens,\" but how often do we keep gazing at the shut door instead of turning our attention to the freshly opened one?"]}
